# Testcontainers Configuration
# ============================
# This file configures Testcontainers behavior for the project.
# For developer-specific settings, also add to ~/.testcontainers.properties

# Enable container reuse between test runs
# This significantly speeds up subsequent test runs by keeping containers alive
testcontainers.reuse.enable=true

# Disable Ryuk (container cleanup) when reuse is enabled
# Ryuk is the container that cleans up test containers after tests complete
# When reuse is enabled, we want containers to persist
ryuk.container.privileged=true
