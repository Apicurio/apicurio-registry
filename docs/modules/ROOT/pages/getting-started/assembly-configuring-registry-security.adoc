= Configuring {registry} authentication and authorization with {keycloak}

[role="_abstract"]
This section explains how to manually configure authentication and authorization options for {registry} and {keycloak}.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, for details on how to configure these settings automatically,
see the link:https://www.apicur.io/registry/docs/apicurio-registry-operator/{operator-version}/assembly-registry-maintenance.html#registry-security-keycloak[{registry} Operator documentation].
====

The {registry} web console and core REST API support authentication in {keycloak} based on OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC). The same {keycloak} realm and users are federated across the {registry} web console and core REST API using OpenID Connect so that you only require one set of credentials.

{registry} provides role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. {registry} provides content-based authorization at the schema or API level, where only the creator of the registry artifact can update or delete it. {registry} authentication and authorization settings are disabled by default.

.Prerequisites
* {keycloak} is installed and running. For more details, see the
link:https://www.keycloak.org/documentation[{keycloak} user documentation].
* {registry} is installed and running.

.Procedure

. In the {keycloak} Admin Console, create a {keycloak} realm for {registry}. By default, {registry} expects a realm name of `registry`. For details on creating realms, see the
link:https://www.keycloak.org/documentation[{keycloak} user documentation].

. Create a {keycloak} client for the {registry} API. By default, {registry} expects the following settings:
** *Client ID*: `registry-api`
** *Client Protocol*: `openid-connect`
** *Access Type*: `bearer-only`
+
You can use the defaults for the other client settings.
+
NOTE: If you are using {keycloak} service accounts, the client *Access Type* must be `confidential` instead of `bearer-only`.

. Create a {keycloak} client for the {registry} web console. By default, {registry} expects the following settings:
** *Client ID*: `apicurio-registry`
** *Client Protocol*: `openid-connect`
** *Access Type*: `public`
** *Valid Redirect URLs*: `\http://my-registry-url:8080/*`
** *Web Origins*: `+`
+
You can use the defaults for the other client settings.

. In your {registry} deployment on OpenShift, set the following {registry} environment variables to configure authentication using {keycloak}:
+

= Configuring {registry} authentication and authorization with Microsoft Azure Active Directory

[role="_abstract"]
This section explains how to manually configure authentication and authorization options for {registry} and Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

The {registry} web console and core REST API support authentication in Azure AD based on OpenID Connect (OIDC) and the OAuth Authorization Code Flow. {registry} provides role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. {registry} authentication and authorization settings are disabled by default.

To secure {registry} with Azure AD, you require a valid directory in Azure AD with specific configuration. This involves registering the {registry} application in the Azure AD portal with recommended settings and configuring environment variables in {registry}.

.Prerequisites
* Azure AD is installed and running. For more details, see the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure[Microsoft Azure AD user documentation].
* {registry} is installed and running.

.Procedure

. Log in to the Azure AD portal using your email address or GitHub account.

. In the navigation menu, select *Manage > App registrations > New registration*, and complete the following settings:
+
** *Name*: Enter your application name. For example: `apicurio-registry-example`
** *Supported account types*: Click *Accounts in any organizational directory*.
** *Redirect URI*: Select *Single-page application* from the list, and enter your {registry} web console application host. For example: `\https://test-registry.com/ui/`
+
IMPORTANT: You must register your {registry} application host as a *Redirect URI*. When logging in, users are redirected from {registry} to Azure AD for authentication, and you want to send them back to your application afterwards. Azure AD does not allow any redirect URLs that are not registered.

. Click *Register*. You can view your app registration details by selecting *Manage > App registrations* > *apicurio-registry-example*.

. Select *Manage > Authentication* and ensure that the application is configured with your redirect URLs and tokens as follows:
** *Redirect URIs*: For example: `\https://test-registry.com/ui/`
** *Implicit grant and hybrid flows*: Click *ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows)*

. Select *Azure AD > Admin > App registrations > Your app > Application (client) ID*. For example: `123456a7-b8c9-012d-e3f4-5fg67h8i901`

. Select *Azure AD > Admin > App registrations > Your app > Directory (tenant) ID*. For example: `\https://login.microsoftonline.com/1a2bc34d-567e-89f1-g0hi-1j2kl3m4no56/v2.0`

. In {registry}, configure the following environment variables with your Azure AD settings:

= {registry} authentication and authorization configuration options

[role="_abstract"]
{registry} provides authentication options for OpenID Connect with {keycloak} and HTTP basic authentication.

{registry} provides authorization options for role-based and content-based approaches:

* Role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles.
* Content-based authorization for schema or API artifacts, where only the owner of the artifacts or artifact group can update or delete artifacts.

IMPORTANT: All authentication and authorization options in {registry} are disabled by default. Before enabling any of these options, you must first set the `QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT_ENABLED` option to `true`.

This chapter provides details on the following configuration options:

* xref:registry-security-authn-keycloak[{registry} authentication by using OpenID Connect with {keycloak}]
* xref:registry-security-authn-http[{registry} authentication by using HTTP basic]
* xref:registry-security-rbac-enabled[{registry} role-based authorization]

[id="registry-security-authn-http"]
== {registry} authentication by using HTTP basic

By default, {registry} supports authentication by using OpenID Connect. Users or API clients must obtain an access token to make authenticated calls to the {registry} REST API.  However, because some tools do not support OpenID Connect, you can also configure {registry} to support HTTP basic authentication by setting the following configuration options to `true`:

.Configuration for {registry} HTTP basic authentication
[%header,cols="4,4,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type

|`apicurio.authn.basic-client-credentials.enabled`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===

[discrete]
=== {registry} HTTP basic client credentials cache expiry

You can also configure the HTTP basic client credentials cache expiry time. By default, when using HTTP basic authentication, {registry} caches JWT tokens, and does not issue a new token when there is no need. You can configure the cache expiry time for JWT tokens, which is set to 10 mins by default.

When using {keycloak}, it is best to set this configuration to your {keycloak} JWT expiry time minus one minute. For example, if you have the expiry time set to `5` mins in {keycloak}, you should set the following configuration option to `4` mins:

.Configuration for HTTP basic client credentials cache expiry

|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`APICURIO_AUTHN_BASIC-CLIENT-CREDENTIALS_CACHE-EXPIRATION`

|===


[discrete]
[id=registry-security-rbac-enabled]
==  {registry} role-based authorization

You can set the following options to `true` to enable role-based authorization in {registry}:

.Configuration for {registry} role-based authorization
[%header,cols="4,4,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT-ENABLED`

|Boolean
|`false`
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ROLE-BASED-AUTHORIZATION`
|`apicurio.auth.role-based-authorization`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===

You can then configure role-based authorization to use roles included in the user's authentication token (for example, granted when authenticating by using {keycloak}), or to use role mappings managed internally by {registry}.

[discrete]
=== Use roles assigned in {keycloak}

To enable using roles assigned by {keycloak}, set the following environment variables:

.Configuration for {registry} role-based authorization by using {keycloak}
[id="registry-security-rbac-keycloak-settings"]
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="6,6,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Description
|Type
|Default
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ROLE-SOURCE`
| When set to `token`, user roles are taken from the authentication token.
|String
|`token`
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ROLES_ADMIN`
|The name of the role that indicates a user is an admin.
|String
|`sr-admin`
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ROLES_DEVELOPER`
|The name of the role that indicates a user is a developer.
|String
|`sr-developer`
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ROLES_READONLY`
|The name of the role that indicates a user has read-only access.
|String
|`sr-readonly`
|===

When {registry} is configured to use roles from {keycloak}, you must assign {registry} users to at least one
of the following user roles in {keycloak}. However, you can configure different user role names by using the environment variables in xref:registry-security-rbac-keycloak-settings[].

.{registry} roles for authentication and authorization
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="2,2,2,2,4",options="header"]

|`sr-readonly`
|Yes
|No
|No
|Access to read and search operations only. This role cannot configure any rules.
|===

[discrete]
=== Manage roles directly in {registry}

To enable using roles managed internally by {registry}, set the following environment variable:

.Configuration for {registry} role-based authorization by using internal role mappings
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="6,6,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Description
|Type
|Default
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ROLE-SOURCE`
| When set to `application`, user roles are managed internally by {registry}.
|String
|`token`
|===

When using internally managed role mappings, users can be assigned a role by using the `/admin/roleMappings`
endpoint in the {registry} REST API.  For more details, see {registry-rest-api}.

Users can be granted exactly one role: `ADMIN`, `DEVELOPER`, or `READ_ONLY`. Only users with admin
privileges can grant access to other users.


[discrete]
=== {registry} admin-override configuration

Because there are no default admin users in {registry}, it is usually helpful to configure another way for users to be identified as admins. You can configure this admin-override feature by using the following environment variables:

.Configuration for {registry} admin-override
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="6,6,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Description
|Type
|Default
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN-OVERRIDE_ENABLED`
| Enables the admin-override feature.
|String
|`false`
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN-OVERRIDE_FROM`
|Where to look for admin-override information.  Only `token` is currently supported.
|String
|`token`
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN-OVERRIDE_TYPE`
|The type of information used to determine if a user is an admin.  Values depend on the value of the FROM variable, for example, `role` or `claim` when FROM is `token`.
|String
|`role`
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN-OVERRIDE_ROLE`
|The name of the role that indicates a user is an admin.
|String
|`sr-admin`
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN-OVERRIDE_CLAIM`
|The name of a JWT token claim to use for determining admin-override.
|String
|`org-admin`
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN-OVERRIDE_CLAIM-VALUE`
|The value that the JWT token claim indicated by the CLAIM variable must be for the user to be granted admin-override.
|String
|`true`
|===

For example, you can use this admin-override feature to assign the `sr-admin` role to a single user
in {keycloak}, which grants that user the admin role.  That user can then use the `/admin/roleMappings`
REST API (or associated UI) to grant roles to additional users (including additional admins).

[discrete]
[id=registry-security-obac-enabled]
== {registry} owner-only authorization

You can set the following options to `true` to enable owner-only authorization for updates to artifacts or artifact groups in {registry}:

.Configuration for owner-only authorization
[%header,cols="4,4,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value

|`QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT_ENABLED`
|`quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled`
|Boolean
|`false`

|`APICURIO_AUTH_OWNER-ONLY-AUTHORIZATION`
|`apicurio.auth.owner-only-authorization`
|Boolean
|`false`

|`APICURIO_AUTH_OWNER-ONLY-AUTHORIZATION_LIMIT-GROUP-ACCESS`
|`apicurio.auth.owner-only-authorization.limit-group-access`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===

When owner-only authorization is enabled, only the user who created an artifact can modify or delete that artifact.

When owner-only authorization and group owner-only authorization are both enabled, only the user who created an artifact group has write access to that artifact group, for example, to add or remove artifacts in that group.

[discrete]
[id=registry-security-auth-read]
== {registry} authenticated read access

When the authenticated read access option is enabled, {registry} grants at least read-only access to requests from any authenticated user in the same organization, regardless of their user role.

To enable authenticated read access, you must first enable role-based authorization, and then ensure that the following options are set to `true`:

.Configuration for authenticated read access
[%header,cols="4,4,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT-ENABLED`

|Boolean
|`false`
|`APICURIO_AUTH_AUTHENTICATED-READ-ACCESS_ENABLED`
|`apicurio.auth.authenticated-read-access.enabled`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===

For more details, see xref:registry-security-rbac-enabled[].

[discrete]
[id=registry-security-anon-read]
== {registry} anonymous read-only access

In addition to the two main types of authorization (role-based and owner-based authorization), {registry}
supports an anonymous read-only access option.

To allow anonymous users, such as REST API calls with no authentication credentials, to make read-only
calls to the REST API, set the following options to `true`:

.Configuration for anonymous read-only access
[%header,cols="4,4,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT-ENABLED`
