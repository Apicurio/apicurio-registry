Client applications can use Registry REST API operations to manage schema and API artifacts in {registry}, for example, in a CI/CD pipeline deployed in production. The Registry REST API provides create, read, update, and delete operations for artifacts, versions, metadata, and rules stored in the registry. For detailed information, see the {registry-rest-api}.

This chapter describes the {registry} core REST API and shows how to use it to manage schema and API artifacts stored in the registry:
