[role="_abstract"]
Client applications can use {registry} REST API operations to manage schema and API artifacts in {registry}, for example, in a CI/CD pipeline deployed in production. The Core Registry API v3 provides operations for artifacts, versions, metadata, and rules stored in {registry}. For detailed information, see the {registry-rest-api}.

This chapter shows examples of how to use the Core Registry API v3 to perform the following tasks:

* xref:managing-artifacts-using-rest-api_{context}[]
* xref:managing-artifact-versions-using-rest-api_{context}[]
* xref:managing-artifact-references-using-rest-api_{context}[]
* xref:exporting-importing-using-rest-api_{context}[]
