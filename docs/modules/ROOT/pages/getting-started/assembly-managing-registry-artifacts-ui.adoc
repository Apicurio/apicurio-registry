= Configuring the {registry} web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can set optional environment variables to configure the {registry} web console specifically for your deployment environment or to customize its behavior.

.Prerequisites
* You have already installed {registry}.

[discrete]
== Configuring the web console deployment environment

When you access the {registry} web console in your browser, some initial configuration settings are loaded. The following configuration settings are required:

* URL for core {registry} server REST API v3

Typically the {registry} operator will automatically configure the UI component with the REST API v3 URL.  However, you can override this value by configuring the appropriate environment variable in the UI component deployment configuration.

.Procedure
Configure the following environment variables to override the default URL:

* `REGISTRY_API_URL`: Specifies the URL for the core {registry} server REST API v3. For example, `\https://registry-api.my-domain.com/apis/registry/v3`

[discrete]
== Configuring the web console in read-only mode

You can configure the {registry} web console in read-only mode as an optional feature. This mode disables all features in the {registry} web console that allow users to make changes to registered artifacts. For example, this includes the following:

* Creating a group
* Creating an artifact
* Uploading a new artifact version
* Updating artifact metadata
* Deleting an artifact

.Procedure
Configure the following environment variable:

* `REGISTRY_FEATURE_READ_ONLY`: Set to `true` to enable read-only mode. Defaults to `false`.

[id="adding-artifacts-using-console_{context}"]
= Adding artifacts using the {registry} web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the {registry} web console to upload schema and API artifacts to {registry}. This section shows simple examples of creating {registry} artifacts and adding new artifact versions.

.Prerequisites

* {registry} is installed and running in your environment.
* You are logged in to the {registry} web console:
+
`{registry-url}`

.Procedure

. On the *Explore* tab, click *Create artifact*, and complete the *Create artifact* wizard:
+
[NOTE]
====
You can create a placeholder artifact without content, but you must specify the artifact type, as {registry} cannot automatically detect the content type.
Creating a placeholder allows you create rules first and add content later.
====

.. Specify the *Artifact Coordinates* and click *Next*:
+
*  *Group ID & Artifact ID*: Use the default empty settings to automatically generate an artifact ID and add the artifact to the `default` artifact group. Alternatively, you can enter an optional artifact group or artifact ID.
* *Type*: Use the default *Auto-Detect* setting to automatically detect the artifact type (not allowed if creating an empty artifact), or select the artifact type from the list, for example, *Avro Schema* or *OpenAPI*. You must manually select the *Kafka Connect Schema* artifact type, which cannot be automatically detected.

.. Specify the *Artifact Metadata* and click *Next*:
+
* *Name*: Enter an optional friendly name for the new artifact.
* *Description*: Enter an optional description for the new artifact.
* *Labels*: Optionally add one or more label (name/value pair) for the new artifact.

.. Specify the *Version Content* and click *Next*:
+
* *Version Number*: Optionally add a version string if creating a first version.
* *Content*: Specify the content using either of the following options:
** *From file*: Click *Browse*, and select a file, or drag and drop a file. For example, `my-openapi.json` or `my-schema.proto`. Alternatively, you can enter the file contents in the text box.
** *From URL*: Enter a valid and accessible URL, and click *Fetch*. For example: `\https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json`.

.. Specify the *Version Metadata*:
+
** *Name*: Enter an optional friendly name for the first artifact version.
** *Description*: Enter an optional description for the first artifact version.
** *Labels*: Optionally add one or more label (name/value pair) for the first artifact version.

. Click *Create* and view the artifact details:
+
** *Overview*: Displays artifact metadata such as artifact ID, name, description, labels, and so on. Also displays rules for validity and compatibility that you can configure for artifact content.
** *Versions*: Displays a list of all artifact versions.  This will be empty unless you chose to upload a first version when you created the artifact.
** *Branches*: Displays a list of branches for the artifact. This will display at least the `latest` branch, but might display other generated branches depending on your configuration.
+
The following example shows an example Apache Avro artifact:
+
.Artifact details in {registry} web console
image::images/getting-started/registry-web-console-artifact.png[Artifact details in Registry web console]

. On the *Overview* tab, click the *Edit* pencil icon to edit artifact metadata such as name or description.
+
You can also add zero or more labels (name + value) for categorizing and searching purposes. To add labels, perform the following steps:
+
.. Click *Add label*.
.. Enter the key name and the value (optional).
.. Repeat the first two steps to add multiple properties.
.. Click *Save*.

. To save the artifact contents to a local file, for example, `my-protobuf-schema.proto` or `my-openapi.json`, click *Download* at the end of the page.

. To add a new artifact version, switch to the **Versions** tab and then click *Create version* in the toolbar.  From there, provide the following information:
.. *Version Number*: Optionally add a version string for the new version.
.. *Content*: Specify the content using either of the following options:
... *From file*: Click *Browse*, and select a file, or drag and drop a file. For example, `my-openapi.json` or `my-schema.proto`. Alternatively, you can enter the file contents in the text box.
... *From URL*: Enter a valid and accessible URL, and click *Fetch*. For example: `\https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json`.
.. Now you can click the *Create* button to create the new version.
. To delete an artifact, click *Delete* in the page header.
+
WARNING: Deleting an artifact deletes the artifact and all of its versions, and cannot be undone.

[id="configuring-rules-using-console_{context}"]
= Configuring content rules using the {registry} web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the {registry} web console to configure optional rules to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to {registry}. All configured artifact-specific, group-specific, or global rules must pass before a new artifact version can be uploaded to {registry}. Configured artifact-specific rules override any configured group-specific rules, which in turn override any global rules. This section shows a simple example of configuring global, group-specific, and artifact-specific rules.

.Prerequisites

* {registry} is installed and running in your environment.
* You are logged in to the {registry} web console:
+
`{registry-url}`
* Artifacts have been added to {registry} using the web console, command line, Maven plug-in, or a Java client application.
* When role-based authorization is enabled, you have administrator access for global rules configuration.

.Procedure (group-specific rules)
. On the *Explore* tab, browse the list of groups in {registry} by selecting *Groups* from the "Search for" menu.
+
. Click a group to view its details and content rules.
+
. In *Group-specific rules*, click *Enable* to configure a validity, compatibility, or integrity rule for all artifact content in the group, and select the appropriate rule configuration from the list. For example, for *Validity rule*, select *Full*.
+

.Procedure (artifact-specific rules)
. On the *Explore* tab, browse the list of artifacts in {registry} by selecting *Artifacts* from the "Search for" menu.
+
. Click an artifact from the list to view its details and content rules.
+
. In *Artifact-specific rules*, click *Enable* to configure a validity, compatibility, or integrity rule for artifact content, and select the appropriate rule configuration from the list. For example, for *Validity rule*, select *Full*.
+

[id="changing-artifact-owner-using-console_{context}"]
= Changing an artifact owner using the {registry} web console

[role="_abstract"]
As an administrator or as an owner of a schema or API artifact, you can use the {registry} web console to change the artifact owner to another user account.

For example, this feature is useful if the *Artifact owner-only authorization* option is set for the {registry} on the *Settings* tab so that only owners or administrators can modify artifacts. You might need to change owner if the owner user leaves the organization or the owner account is deleted.  Or if you simply need to transition modification authorization to a new user.

NOTE: The *Artifact owner-only authorization* setting and the artifact *Owner* field are displayed _only if_ authentication was enabled when the {registry} was deployed. For more details, see

xref:../getting-started/assembly-configuring-the-registry.adoc[].

.Prerequisites

* The {registry} is deployed and the artifact is created.
* You are logged in to the {registry} web console as the artifact's current owner or as an administrator:
+
`{registry-url}`

.Procedure


. On the *Explore* tab, browse the list of artifacts stored in {registry}, or enter a search string to find the artifact. You can select from the list to search by criteria such as name, group, labels, or global ID.

. Click the artifact that you want to reassign.

. In the *Overview* section, click the pencil icon next to the *Owner* field.

. In the *New owner* field, select or enter an account name.

. Click *Change owner*.

= Exporting and importing data using the {registry} web console

[role="_abstract"]
As an administrator, you can use the {registry} web console to export data from one {registry} instance, and import this data into another {registry} instance. You can use this feature to easily migrate data between different instances.

The following example shows how to export and import existing data in a `.zip` file from one {registry} instance to another instance. All the artifact data contained in the {registry} instance is exported in the `.zip` file.

.Prerequisites

* {registry} instances have been created as follows:
** The source instance that you are exporting from contains at least one schema or API artifact
** The target instance that you are importing into is empty to preserve unique IDs
* You are logged into the {registry} web console with administrator access:
+
`{registry-url}`

.Procedure

. In the web console for the source {registry} instance, view the *Explore* tab.

. Click the additional actions icon (three vertical dots) next to *Create artifact* in the toolbar, and select *Export all (as .ZIP)* to export the data for this {registry} instance to a `.zip` download file.

. In the web console for the target {registry} instance, view the *Explore* tab.

. Click the additional actions icon (three vertical dots) next to *Create artifact* in the toolbar, and select *Import from .ZIP*.

. Drag and drop or browse to the `.zip` download file that you exported earlier.

. Click *Import* and wait for the data to be imported.
