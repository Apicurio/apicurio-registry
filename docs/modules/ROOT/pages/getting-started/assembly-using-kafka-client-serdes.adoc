[role="_abstract"]
{registry} provides client serializers/deserializers (SerDes) for Kafka producer and consumer applications written in Java. Kafka producer applications use serializers to encode messages that conform to a specific event schema. Kafka consumer applications use deserializers to validate that messages have been serialized using the correct schema, based on a specific schema ID. This ensures consistent schema use and helps to prevent data errors at runtime.

This chapter explains how to use Kafka client SerDes in your producer and consumer client applications:
