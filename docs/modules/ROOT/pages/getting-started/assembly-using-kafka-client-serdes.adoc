{registry} provides Kafka client serializers/deserializers for producer and consumer applications. Kafka producer applications use serializers to encode messages that conform to a specific event schema. Kafka consumer applications use deserializers to validate that the messages have been serialized using the correct schema, based on a specific schema ID. This ensures consistent schema use and helps to prevent data errors at runtime. 

This chapter provides instructions on how to use the Kafka client serializer and deserializer for Apache Avro in your Kafka producer and consumer client applications:

* xref:registry-serdes-concepts-serde-{context}[]
* xref:registry-serdes-concepts-strategy-{context}[]
* xref:registry-serdes-concepts-constants-{context}[]
* xref:registry-serdes-register-{context}[]
* xref:registry-serdes-config-consumer-{context}[]
* xref:registry-serdes-config-producer-{context}[]

.Prerequisites
* You must have read {registry-overview}
* You must have installed {registry}. 
* You must have created Kafka producer and consumer client applications.
