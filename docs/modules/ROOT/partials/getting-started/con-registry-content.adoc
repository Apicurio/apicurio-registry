= Manage {registry} content using client tools

[role="_abstract"]
You can manage {registry} content using the {registry} web console, REST API, command line, Maven plug-in, or client SDKs.
 
== {registry} web console
You can use the {registry} web console to browse and search the schema and API artifacts, groups, and versions stored in {registry}, and to add new schema and API artifacts, groups, and versions. You can also configure optional validation or compatibility rules for {registry} content, both globally and for each schema and API artifact.

== Core Registry API
Using the Core Registry API, client applications can manage the schema and API artifacts in {registry}. This API provides create, read, update, and delete operations for artifacts, versions, metadata, and rules. It also provides search and admin operations, such as managing global rules or importing and exporting {registry} data.

{registry} provides compatibility with other schema registry APIs, such as Confluent Schema Registry.

== {registry} SDKs
You can use the {registry} language SDKs to create, read, update, or delete artifacts stored in {registry}. You can also perform admin functions using the SDKs, such as managing global rules or importing and exporting {registry} data.

== {registry} Maven plug-in
You can use the {registry} Maven plug-in to add, download, or test {registry} artifacts in a Maven build. This includes adding artifacts during a build, or downloading artifacts when generating code from a schema. If content rules are configured, you can test that artifacts can be added before making changes.
