=  Validate Kafka messages using schemas and Java client serializers/deserializers 

[role="_abstract"]
Kafka producer applications can use serializers to encode messages that conform to a specific event schema. Kafka consumer applications can then use deserializers to validate that messages have been serialized using the correct schema, based on a specific schema ID. 

.{registry} and Kafka client SerDes architecture
image::images/getting-started/registry-serdes-architecture.png[Kafka client SerDes architecture]

{registry} provides Kafka client serializers/deserializers (SerDes) to validate the following message types at runtime:

* Apache Avro
* Google Protobuf
* JSON Schema

The {registry} Maven repository and source code distributions include the Kafka SerDes implementations for these message types, which Kafka client application developers can use to integrate with {registry}.

These implementations include custom Java classes for each supported message type, for example, `io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro`, which client applications can use to pull schemas from {registry} at runtime for validation.
