[id='registry-serdes-types-protobuf-{context}']

= Configure Protobuf SerDe with {registry}

{registry} provides the following Kafka client serializer and deserializer classes for Google Protobuf:

* `io.apicurio.registry.serde.protobuf.ProtobufKafkaSerializer`
* `io.apicurio.registry.serde.protobuf.ProtobufKafkaDeserializer`

.Configure the Protobuf serializer

You can configure the Protobuf serializer class in the following ways:

* {registry} location as a URL
* Artifact resolver strategy 
* Schema resolver strategy 
* Global ID location
* Global ID handler

For details, see the following sections: 

* xref:registry-serdes-concepts-constants-registry[]
* xref:registry-serdes-types-avro-registry[]

.Configure the Protobuf deserializer

You must configure the Protobuf deserializer class to match the following configuration settings in the serializer:

* {registry} location as a URL
* Global ID handler

The configuration property names and values are the same as for the serializer.

[NOTE]
====
The following options are not required when configuring the deserializer:

* Artifact resolver strategy 
* Schema resolver strategy 
* Global ID location
====

These options are not required because the deserializer class can determine this from the message. The strategies are not required because the serializer is responsible for sending the global ID as part of the message. 

The location of the global ID is determined by checking for the magic byte at the start of the message payload. If that byte is found, the global ID is read from the message payload using the configured handler.  If the magic byte is not found, the global ID is read from the message headers.

NOTE: The Protobuf deserializer does not deserialize to your exact Protobuf Message implementation,
but rather to a `DynamicMessage` instance. There is no appropriate API to do otherwise.
