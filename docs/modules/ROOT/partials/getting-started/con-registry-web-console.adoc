= {registry} web console

You can use the {registry} web console to browse and search the artifacts stored in the registry, and to upload new artifacts and artifact versions. You can search for artifacts by label, name, and description. You can also view an artifactâ€™s content, view all of its available versions, or download an artifact file locally.

You can also use the {registry} web console to configure optional rules for registry content, both globally and for each artifact. These optional rules for content validation and compatibility are applied when new artifacts or artifact versions are uploaded to the registry. For more details, see {registry-rule-types} and {registry-rule-maturity-matrix}.
