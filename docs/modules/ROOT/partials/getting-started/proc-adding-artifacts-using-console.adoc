= Adding artifacts using the {registry} web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the {registry} web console to upload event schema and API design artifacts to the registry. 
This section shows simple examples of uploading {registry} artifacts and adding new artifact versions. 

.Prerequisites

ifdef::apicurio-registry,rh-service-registry[]
* {registry} must be installed and running in your environment
endif::[]
ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
* You must have access to the {registry} web console
endif::[]

.Procedure

. Connect to the {registry} web console on:
+
`*{registry-url}*`
ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
. Click your existing {registry} instance, or click *Create {registry} instance* to provision a new one. 
endif::[]
. Click *Upload artifact*, and specify the following:
** *Group & ID*: Use the default empty settings to automatically generate an ID and `default` group, or enter an optional artifact group or ID.
** *Type*: Use the default *Auto-Detect* setting to automatically detect the artifact type, or select the artifact type from the drop-down, for example, *Avro Schema* or *OpenAPI*.
+
NOTE:  {registry} cannot automatically detect the *Kafka Connect Schema* artifact type. You must manually select this artifact type.
** *Artifact*: Drag and drop or click *Browse* to upload a file, for example, `my-schema.json` or `my-openapi.json`.

. Click *Upload* and view the *Artifact Details*. This example shows an Avro schema artifact:
+

endif::[]
ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
image::../_images/user-guide/registry-web-console-artifact.png[Artifact Details in Registry web console]
endif::[]
+
** *Info*: Displays the artifact name and optional group, description, lifecycle status, when created, and last modified. 
+
Click the *Edit Artifact Metadata* pencil icon to edit the artifact name and description or add labels, and click *Download* to download the artifact file locally. Also displays artifact *Content Rules* that you can enable and configure.
** *Documentation* (OpenAPI artifacts only): Displays automatically-generated REST API documentation.
** *Content*: Displays a read-only view of the full artifact content.

. Click *Upload new version* to add a new artifact version, and drag and drop or click *Browse* to upload the file, for example, `my-schema.json` or `my-openapi.json`.

. To delete an artifact, click the delete button next to *Upload new version*.
+
WARNING: Deleting an artifact deletes the artifact and all of its versions, and cannot be undone. Artifact versions are immutable and cannot be deleted individually.
