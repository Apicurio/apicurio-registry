= Adding artifacts using the {registry} web console

You can use the {registry} web console to upload event schema and API design artifacts to the registry. For more details on the artifact types that you can upload, see {registry-reference}. This section shows simple examples of uploading {registry} artifacts, applying artifact rules, and adding new artifact versions.

.Prerequisites

* {registry} must be installed and running in your environment.

.Procedure

. Connect to the {registry} web console on:
+
`*\http://MY_REGISTRY_URL/ui*`

. Click *Upload Artifact*, and specify the following:
** *Group & ID*: Use the default empty settings to automatically generate an ID, or enter an optional artifact group or ID. 
** *Type*: Use the default *Auto-Detect* setting to automatically detect the artifact type, or select the artifact type from the drop-down, for example, *Avro Schema* or *OpenAPI*.
+
NOTE:  The {registry} server cannot automatically detect the *Kafka Connect Schema* artifact type. You must manually select this artifact type.
** *Artifact*: Drag and drop or click *Browse* to upload a file, for example, `my-schema.json` or `my-openapi.json`.

. Click *Upload* and view the *Artifact Details*:
+

+
** *Info*: Displays the artifact name and optional group, description, lifecycle status, when created, and last modified. Click the *Edit Artifact Metadata* pencil icon to edit the artifact name and description or add labels, and click *Download* to download the artifact file locally. Also displays artifact *Content Rules* that you can enable and configure.
** *Documentation* (OpenAPI only): Displays automatically-generated REST API documentation.
** *Content*: Displays a read-only view of the full artifact content.

. In *Content Rules*, click *Enable* to configure a *Validity Rule* or *Compatibility Rule*, and select the appropriate rule configuration from the drop-down. For more details, see {registry-reference}.

. Click *Upload new version* to add a new artifact version, and drag and drop or click *Browse* to upload the file, for example, `my-schema.json` or `my-openapi.json`.

. To delete an artifact, click the trash icon next to *Upload new version*.
+
WARNING: Deleting an artifact deletes the artifact and all of its versions, and cannot be undone. Artifact versions are immutable and cannot be deleted individually.
