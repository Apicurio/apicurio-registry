= Viewing artifacts using the {registry} web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the {registry} web console to browse the schema and API artifacts stored in {registry}. This section shows a simple example of viewing {registry} groups, artifacts, versions, and rules.

.Prerequisites

* {registry} is installed and running in your environment.
* You are logged in to the {registry} web console:
+ 
`{registry-url}`
* Artifacts have been added to {registry} using the web console, command line, Maven plug-in, or a client application.

.Procedure

. On the *Explore* tab, browse the list of artifacts stored in {registry}, or enter a search string to find an artifact. You can select from the list to search by specific criteria such as name, group, labels, or global ID.

. Click an artifact to view the following details:

** *Overview*: Displays artifact metadata such as artifact ID, name, description, labels, and so on. Also displays rules for validity and compatibility that you can configure for artifact content.
** *Versions*: Displays a list of all artifact versions.  This will be empty unless you chose to upload a first version when you created the artifact.
** *Branches*: Displays a list of branches for the artifact. This will display at least the `latest` branch, but might display other generated branches depending on your configuration.

. Click the *Versions* tab to view a list of all artifact versions.  Then click one of the versions in the list, or choose *View Version* from the Action menu for a version in the list.  You will then see the following artifact version details:

** *Overview*: Displays artifact version metadata such as version name, description, global ID, content ID, labels, and so on. Also displays any comments created for the artifact version.
** *Documentation* (OpenAPI and AsyncAPI only): Displays automatically-generated REST API documentation.
** *Content*: Displays a read-only view of the full artifact version content. For JSON content, you can click *JSON* or *YAML* to display your preferred format.
** *References*: Displays a read-only view of all artifacts referenced by this artifact version. You can also click *View artifacts that reference this artifact version*.
