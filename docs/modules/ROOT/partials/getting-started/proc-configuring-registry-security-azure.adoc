= Configuring {registry} authentication and authorization with Microsoft Azure Active Directory

[role="_abstract"]
This section explains how to manually configure authentication and authorization options for {registry} and Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). 

The {registry} web console and core REST API support authentication in Azure AD based on OpenID Connect (OIDC) and the OAuth Authorization Code Flow. {registry} provides role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. {registry} authentication and authorization settings are disabled by default. 

To secure {registry} with Azure AD, you require a valid directory in Azure AD with specific configuration. This involves registering the {registry} application in the Azure AD portal with recommended settings and configuring environment variables in {registry}.  

.Prerequisites
* Azure AD is installed and running. For more details, see the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure[Microsoft Azure AD user documentation]. 
* {registry} is installed and running.

.Procedure

. Log in to the Azure AD portal using your email address or GitHub account. 

. In the navigation menu, select *Manage > App registrations > New registration*, and complete the following settings: 
+
** *Name*: Enter your application name. For example: `apicurio-registry-example` 
** *Supported account types*: Click *Accounts in any organizational directory*.
** *Redirect URI*: Select *Single-page application* from the list, and enter your {registry} web console application host. For example: `\https://test-registry.com/ui/`
+
IMPORTANT: You must register your {registry} application host as a *Redirect URI*. When logging in, users are redirected from {registry} to Azure AD for authentication, and you want to send them back to your application afterwards. Azure AD does not allow any redirect URLs that are not registered. 

. Click *Register*. You can view your app registration details by selecting *Manage > App registrations* > *apicurio-registry-example*.

. Select *Manage > Authentication* and ensure that the application is configured with your redirect URLs and tokens as follows:
** *Redirect URIs*: For example: `\https://test-registry.com/ui/`
** *Implicit grant and hybrid flows*: Click *ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows)*

. Select *Azure AD > Admin > App registrations > Your app > Application (client) ID*. For example: `123456a7-b8c9-012d-e3f4-5fg67h8i901`

. Select *Azure AD > Admin > App registrations > Your app > Directory (tenant) ID*. For example: `\https://login.microsoftonline.com/1a2bc34d-567e-89f1-g0hi-1j2kl3m4no56/v2.0`

. In {registry}, configure the following environment variables with your Azure AD settings:

|`KEYCLOAK_API_CLIENT_ID`
|The client application ID for the {registry} REST API
|Your Azure AD Application (client) ID obtained in step 5. For example: `123456a7-b8c9-012d-e3f4-5fg67h8i901`
|`REGISTRY_OIDC_UI_CLIENT_ID`
|The client application ID for the {registry} web console.
|Your Azure AD Application (client) ID obtained in step 5. For example: `123456a7-b8c9-012d-e3f4-5fg67h8i901`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_URL_CONFIGURED`
|The URL for authentication in Azure AD.

|Environment variable
|Description
|Setting
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ENABLED`
|Enables authentication for {registry}.
|`true`
|`REGISTRY_UI_AUTH_TYPE`
|The {registry} authentication type.
|`oidc`
|`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
|The host for your {registry} deployment for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
|For example: `\https://test-registry.com`
|`REGISTRY_OIDC_UI_REDIRECT_URL`
|The host for your {registry} web console.
|For example: `\https://test-registry.com/ui`
|`APICURIO_AUTH_ROLE_BASED_AUTHORIZATION`

|`true`
|`QUARKUS_OIDC_ROLES_ROLE_CLAIM_PATH`
