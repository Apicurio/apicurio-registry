= Configuring content rules using the {registry} web console

You can use the {registry} web console to configure optional rules to prevent invalid content from being added to the registry. All configured artifact rules or global rules must pass before a new artifact version can be uploaded to the registry. Configured artifact rules override any configured global rules. For more details, see {registry-rules}.

This section shows a simple example of configuring global and artifact rules. For details on the different rule types and associated configuration settings that you can select, see {registry-reference}.  

.Prerequisites

* {registry} must be installed and running in your environment.
* For artifact rules, artifacts must have been added to the registry using the {registry} web console, REST API commands, Maven plug-in, or a Java client application. 

.Procedure

. Connect to the {registry} web console on: 
+
`*\http://MY_REGISTRY_URL/ui*`

. For artifact rules, browse the list of artifacts stored in the registry, or enter a search string to find an artifact. You can select to search by a specific artifact *Name*, *Group*, *Description*, or *Labels*.  

. Click *View artifact* to view the *Artifact Details*.

. In *Content Rules*, click *Enable* to configure an artifact *Validity Rule* or *Compatibility Rule*, and select the appropriate rule configuration from the drop-down. For more details, see {registry-reference}.
