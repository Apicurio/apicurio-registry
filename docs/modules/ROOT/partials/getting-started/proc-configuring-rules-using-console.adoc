= Configuring content rules using the {registry} web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the {registry} web console to configure optional rules to prevent invalid content from being added to the registry. All configured artifact rules or global rules must pass before a new artifact version can be uploaded to the registry. Configured artifact rules override any configured global rules. This section shows a simple example of configuring global and artifact rules.
