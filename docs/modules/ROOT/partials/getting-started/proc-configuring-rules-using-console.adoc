= Configuring content rules using the {registry} web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the {registry} web console to configure optional rules to prevent invalid content from being added to the registry. All configured artifact rules or global rules must pass before a new artifact version can be uploaded to {registry}. Configured artifact rules override any configured global rules. This section shows a simple example of configuring global and artifact rules.

.Prerequisites

ifdef::apicurio-registry,rh-service-registry[]
* {registry} is installed and running in your environment.
endif::[]
* You are logged in to the {registry} web console:
+ 
`{registry-url}`
ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
* You have access to a running {registry} instance.
endif::[]
* Artifacts have been added to {registry} using the web console, command line, Maven plug-in, or a Java client application. 

.Procedure

ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
. In the {registry} web console, click your existing {registry} instance. 
endif::[]
. On the *Artifacts* tab, browse the list of artifacts in {registry}, or enter a search string to find an artifact. You can select from the list to search by specific criteria such as artifact name, group, labels, or global ID. 

. Click an artifact to view its version details and content rules.

. In *Content rules*, click *Enable* to configure an validity rule or compatibility rule for artifact content, and select the appropriate rule configuration from the list, for example, *Full* for the validity rule.
