= Configuring content rules using the {registry} web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the {registry} web console to configure optional rules to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to {registry}. All configured artifact-specific, group-specific, or global rules must pass before a new artifact version can be uploaded to {registry}. Configured artifact-specific rules override any configured group-specific rules, which in turn override any global rules. This section shows a simple example of configuring global, group-specific, and artifact-specific rules.

.Prerequisites

* {registry} is installed and running in your environment.
* You are logged in to the {registry} web console:
+ 
`{registry-url}`
* Artifacts have been added to {registry} using the web console, command line, Maven plug-in, or a Java client application.
* When role-based authorization is enabled, you have administrator access for global rules configuration.

.Procedure (group-specific rules)
. On the *Explore* tab, browse the list of groups in {registry} by selecting *Groups* from the "Search for" menu.
+
. Click a group to view its details and content rules.
+
. In *Group-specific rules*, click *Enable* to configure a validity, compatibility, or integrity rule for all artifact content in the group, and select the appropriate rule configuration from the list. For example, for *Validity rule*, select *Full*.

.Procedure (artifact-specific rules)
. On the *Explore* tab, browse the list of artifacts in {registry} by selecting *Artifacts* from the "Search for" menu.
+
. Click an artifact from the list to view its details and content rules.
+
. In *Artifact-specific rules*, click *Enable* to configure a validity, compatibility, or integrity rule for artifact content, and select the appropriate rule configuration from the list. For example, for *Validity rule*, select *Full*.

NOTE: To disable an artifact-specific, group-specific, or global rule, click the trash icon next to the rule.  If you do this, and the rule is configured at a higher level (e.g. Global), then the higher level rule configuration will once again be applied.
