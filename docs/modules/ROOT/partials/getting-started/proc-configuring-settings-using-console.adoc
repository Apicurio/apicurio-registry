= Configuring {registry} settings using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
As an administrator, you can use the {registry} web console to configure dynamic settings for {registry} at runtime. You can manage configuration options for features such as authentication, authorization, and API compatibility.

//This section shows how to configure..

NOTE: Authentication and authorization settings are only displayed in the web console if authentication was already enabled when the {registry} was deployed. For more details, see
ifdef::apicurio-registry[]
