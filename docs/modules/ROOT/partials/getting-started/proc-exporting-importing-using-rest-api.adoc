= Exporting and importing registry content using {registry} REST API commands

[role="_abstract"]
As an administrator, you can use the {registry} REST API to export data from one {registry} instance and import it into another {registry} instance, so you can migrate data between different instances.

This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the core registry v2 REST API to export and import existing registry data in `.zip` format from one {registry} instance to another. All of the artifact data contained in the {registry} instance is exported in the `.zip` file.

ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
NOTE: You can import {registry} data that has previously been exported from another {product-long-registry} instance. You cannot currently import {registry} data from a {org-name} Integration {registry} instance.   
endif::[]

.Prerequisites

ifdef::apicurio-registry,rh-service-registry[]
* {registry} is installed and running in your environment
endif::[]
* {registry} instances have been created: 
** The source instance that you want to export data from contains at least one schema or API artifact 
** The target instance that you want to import data into can contain artifacts or be empty 
ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
* You have a service account with administrator access to the {registry} instances
* You have created an access token using your service account credentials 
endif::[]

.Procedure

ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
. Connect to the {registry} web console on: 
+
{registry-url}

. For the {registry} instance that you want to connect to, select the options icon (three vertical dots) and click *Connection*.
. In the *Connection* page, copy the URL for the *Core Registry API* to a secure location. This is the registry API endpoint that you need for connecting to this {registry} instance. 
endif::[]

. Export the registry data from your existing source {registry} instance:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/admin/export \ 
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \ 
  --output my-registry-data.zip
----
+
`MY-REGISTRY-URL` is the 
ifdef::apicurio-registry[]
host name on which the source {registry} is deployed. For example: `\http://my-source-registry:8080`.
endif::[]
ifdef::rh-service-registry[]
host name on which the source {registry} is deployed. For example: `my-cluster-source-registry-myproject.example.com`. 
endif::[]
ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
URL on which the source {registry} is deployed. For example: `\https://service-registry-source.apps.app-sre-0.k3s7.p1.openshiftapps.com/t/f301375a-18a7-426c-bbd8-8e626a0a1d0e`. 
endif::[]

. Import the registry data into your target {registry} instance:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X POST "http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/admin/import" \ 
  -H "Content-Type: application/zip" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  --data-binary @my-registry-data.zip
----
+
`MY-REGISTRY-URL` is the 
ifdef::apicurio-registry[]
host name on which the target {registry} is deployed. For example: `\http://my-target-registry:8080`.
endif::[]
ifdef::rh-service-registry[]
host name on which the target {registry} is deployed. For example: `my-cluster-target-registry-myproject.example.com`. 
endif::[]
ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
URL on which the target {registry} is deployed. For example: `\https://service-registry-target.apps.app-sre-0.k3s7.p1.openshiftapps.com/t/f301375a-18a7-426c-bbd8-8e626a0a1d0e`.
