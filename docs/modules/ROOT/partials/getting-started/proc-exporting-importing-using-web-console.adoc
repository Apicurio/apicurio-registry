= Exporting and importing registry content using {registry} web console

[role="_abstract"]
As an administrator, you can use the web console to export {registry} data from one {registry} instance and import it into another {registry} instance, so you can easily migrate {registry} data between different instances.

This section shows an example of using the {registry} web console to export and import existing registry data in `.zip` format from one {registry} instance to another. All of the artifact data contained in the {registry} instance is exported in the `.zip` file.

ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
IMPORTANT: You can import {registry} data that has been exported from another {product-long-registry} instance. You cannot currently import {registry} data from a {org-name} Integration {registry} instance.   

This example shows exporting and importing {registry} data from the *Artifacts* page for that instance. You can also export {registry} data when prompted before deleting an instance.

.Prerequisites

* {registry} instances have been created: 
** The source instance that you want to export data from contains at least one schema or API artifact 
** The target instance that you want to import data into can contain artifacts or be empty 
* You have administrator access to the {registry} web console

endif::[] 

ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
. In the web console, in the list of instances, select the source {registry} instance that you want to export data from, and view the *Artifacts* page.  
endif::[]

ifdef::apicurio-registry,rh-service-registry[]
. In the  the web console for the target {registry} instance that you want to export data to, select the *Artifacts* page.  
endif::[] 

ifdef::rh-openshift-sr[]
. Go back to the list of instances, select the target {registry} instance that you want to import data into, and view the *Artifacts* page.     
endif::[]

. Next to the *Upload artifacts* button, select the options icon (three vertical dots), and click *Upload multiple artifacts*.
