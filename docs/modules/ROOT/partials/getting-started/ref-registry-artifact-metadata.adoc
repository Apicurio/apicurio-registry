= {registry} artifact metadata

[role="_abstract"]
When an artifact is added to {registry}, a set of metadata properties is stored along with the artifact content. This metadata consists of a set of generated read-only properties, along with some editable properties that you can set.

|===
|Property
|Type
|Description
|`contentId`
|integer
|Unique identifier of artifact content in {registry}. The same content ID can be shared by multiple artifact versions when the artifact versions are identical. For example, a content ID of `4` can be used by multiple artifact versions with the same content. 
|`createdBy`
|string
|The name of the user who created the artifact.
|`createdOn`
|date
|The date and time at which the artifact was created, for example, `2023-10-11T14:15:28Z`.
|`globalId`
|integer
|Globally unique identifier of an artifact version in {registry}. For example, a global ID of `1` is assigned to the first artifact version created in {registry}.
|`groupId`
|string
|Unique identifier of an artifact group in {registry}, for example, `development` or `production`. If no group is specified when creating an artifact in the {registry} web console, the group ID is set to `default`.
|`id`
|string
|Unique identifier of an artifact in {registry}. Can be a string provided by the client or user, or a UUID generated by the {registry} server, for example, `8d168cad-1865-4e6c-bb7e-04e8be005bea`. Different versions of an artifact use the same artifact ID, but have different global IDs. 
|`modifiedBy`
|string
|The name of the user who modified the artifact.
|`modifiedOn`
|date
|The date and time at which the artifact was modified, for example, `2023-10-11T14:15:28Z`.
|`references`
|array of ArtifactReference
|The set of all artifact references contained in the artifact. The following simple example shows a single artifact reference: 
`[{"groupId":"my-group","artifactId":"ItemId","version":"1","name":"com.example.common.ItemId"}]`.
|`type`
|ArtifactType
|The supported artifact type, for example, `AVRO`, `OPENAPI`, or `PROTOBUF`. 
|`version`

.Updating artifact metadata
* You can use the {registry} REST API or web console to update the set of editable metadata properties.
* However, you can edit the `state` property only by using the {registry} REST API.
