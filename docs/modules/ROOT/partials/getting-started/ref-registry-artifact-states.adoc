|State
|Description
|`ENABLED`
|Basic state, all the operations are available.
|`DISABLED`
|The artifact and its metadata is viewable and searchable using the {registry} web console, but its content cannot be fetched by any client.
|`DEPRECATED`
|The artifact is fully usable but a header is added to the REST API response whenever the artifact content is fetched. The {registry} Rest Client will also log a warning whenever it sees deprecated content.
