= {registry} authentication and authorization configuration options

[role="_abstract"]
{registry} provides authentication options for OpenID Connect with {keycloak} or HTTP basic authentication.  

{registry} provides authorization options for role-based and content-based approaches: 

* Role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. 
* Content-based authorization for schema or API artifacts, where only the owner of the artifacts or artifact group can update or delete artifacts. 

NOTE: {registry} authentication and authorization options are disabled by default.

This chapter provides details on the following configuration options: 

* xref:registry-security-authn-keycloak[{registry} authentication using OpenID Connect with {keycloak}]
* xref:registry-security-authn-http[{registry} authentication using HTTP basic]
* xref:registry-security-rbac-enabled[{registry} role-based authorization] 
* xref:registry-security-obac-enabled[{registry} owner-only authorization] 
* xref:registry-security-auth-read[{registry} authenticated read access] 
* xref:registry-security-anon-read[{registry} anonymous read-only access]

== {registry} authentication using OpenID Connect with {keycloak} 

You can set the following environment variables to configure authentication for the {registry} web console and API using {keycloak}:

.Configuration for {registry} authentication options
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="5,6,2,4",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Description
|Type
|Default
|`AUTH_ENABLED`
|Enables or disables authentication in {registry}.  When set to `true`, the environment variables that follow are required.
|String
|`false`
|`KEYCLOAK_URL`
|The URL of the {keycloak} authentication server to use. Must end with `/auth`.
|String
|-
|`KEYCLOAK_REALM`
|The {keycloak} realm used for authentication.
|String
|-
|`KEYCLOAK_API_CLIENT_ID`
|The client ID for the {registry} REST API.

[id="registry-security-authn-http"]
== {registry} authentication using HTTP basic

NOTE: By default, {registry} supports authentication using OpenID Connect. Users (or API clients) must obtain an access token to make authenticated calls to the {registry} REST API.  However, because some tools do not support OpenID Connect, you can also configure {registry} to support HTTP basic authentication by setting the following configuration option to `true`.

.Configuration for {registry} HTTP basic authentication
[%header,cols="4,4,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_BASIC_AUTH_ENABLED`
|`registry.auth.basic-auth-client-credentials.enabled`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===


[discrete]
[id=registry-security-rbac-enabled]
==  {registry} role-based authorization

You can set the following option to `true` to enable role-based authorization in {registry}:

.Configuration for {registry} role-based authorization
[%header,cols="4,4,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_ENABLED`
|`registry.auth.role-based-authorization`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===

You can then configure role-based authorization to use roles included in the user's authentication token (for example, granted when authenticating using {keycloak}), or to use role mappings managed internally by {registry}.

[discrete]
=== Use roles assigned in {keycloak}

To enable using roles assigned by {keycloak}, set the following environment variables:

.Configuration for {registry} role-based authorization using {keycloak}
[id="registry-security-rbac-keycloak-settings"]
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="6,6,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Description
|Type
|Default
|`ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_SOURCE`
| When set to `token`, user roles are taken from the authentication token.
|String
|`token`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_ADMIN`
|The name of the role that indicates a user is an admin.
|String
|`sr-admin`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_DEVELOPER`
|The name of the role that indicates a user is a developer.
|String
|`sr-developer`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_READONLY`
|The name of the role that indicates a user has read-only access.
|String
|`sr-readonly`
|===

When {registry} is configured to use roles from {keycloak}, you must assign {registry} users to at least one
of the following user roles in {keycloak}. However, you can configure different user role names using the environment variables in xref:registry-security-rbac-keycloak-settings[].

.{registry} roles for authentication and authorization
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="2,2,2,2,4",options="header"]
|===
|Role name
|Read artifacts
|Write artifacts
|Global rules
|Description
|`sr-admin`
|Yes
|Yes
|Yes
|Full access to all create, read, update, and delete operations.
|`sr-developer`
|Yes
|Yes
|No
|Access to create, read, update, and delete operations, except configuring global rules and import/export. This role can configure artifact rules only.
|`sr-readonly`
|Yes
|No
|No
|Access to read and search operations only. This role cannot configure any rules.
|===

=== Manage roles directly in {registry}

To enable using roles managed internally by {registry}, set the following environment variables:

.Configuration for {registry} role-based authorization using internal role mappings
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="6,6,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Description
|Type
|Default
|`ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_SOURCE`
| When set to `application`, user roles are managed internally by {registry}.
|String
|`token`
|===

When using internally managed role mappings, users can be assigned a role using the `/admin/roleMappings`
endpoint in the {registry} REST API.  For more details, see {registry-rest-api}.

Users can be granted exactly one role: `ADMIN`, `DEVELOPER`, or `READ_ONLY`. Only users with admin
privileges can grant access to other users.

=== {registry} admin-override configuration

Because there are no default admin users in {registry}, it is usually helpful to configure another way for users to be identified as admins. You can configure this admin-override feature using the following environment variables:

.Configuration for {registry} admin-override 
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="6,6,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Description
|Type
|Default
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_ENABLED`
| Enables the admin-override feature.
|String
|`false`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_FROM`
|Where to look for admin-override information.  Only `token` is currently supported.
|String
|`token`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_TYPE`
|The type of information used to determine if a user is an admin.  Values depend on the value of the FROM variable, for example, `role` or `claim` when FROM is `token`.
|String
|`role`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_ROLE`
|The name of the role that indicates a user is an admin.
|String
|`sr-admin`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CLAIM`
|The name of a JWT token claim to use for determining admin-override.
|String
|`org-admin`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CLAIM_VALUE`
|The value that the JWT token claim indicated by the CLAIM variable must be for the user to be granted admin-override.
|String
|`true`
|===

For example, you can use this admin-override feature to assign the `sr-admin` role to a single user
in {keycloak}, which grants that user the admin role.  That user can then use the `/admin/roleMappings`
REST API (or associated UI) to grant roles to additional users (including additional admins).

[discrete]
[id=registry-security-obac-enabled]
== {registry} owner-only authorization

You can set the following options to `true` to enable owner-only authorization for updates to artifacts or artifact groups in {registry}:

.Configuration for owner-only authorization
[%header,cols="4,4,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value

|`REGISTRY_AUTH_OBAC_ENABLED`
|`registry.auth.owner-only-authorization`
|Boolean
|`false`

|`REGISTRY_AUTH_OBAC_LIMIT_GROUP_ACCESS`
|`registry.auth.owner-only-authorization.limit-group-access`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===

When owner-only authorization is enabled, only the user who created an artifact can modify or delete that artifact.

When owner-only authorization and group owner-only authorization are both enabled, only the user who created an artifact group has write access to that artifact group, for example, to add or remove artifacts in that group.

[discrete]
[id=registry-security-auth-read]
== {registry} authenticated read access

When the authenticated read access option is enabled, {registry} grants at least read-only access to requests from any authenticated user in the same organization, regardless of their user role. 

To enable authenticated read access, you must first enable role-based authorization, and then set the following option to `true`:

.Configuration for authenticated read access
[%header,cols="4,4,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_AUTHENTICATED_READS_ENABLED`
|`registry.auth.authenticated-read-access.enabled`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===

For more details, see xref:registry-security-rbac-enabled[].

[discrete]
[id=registry-security-anon-read]
== {registry} anonymous read-only access

In addition to the two main types of authorization (role-based and owner-based authorization), {registry}
supports an anonymous read-only access option.

To allow anonymous users, such as REST API calls with no authentication credentials, to make read-only 
calls to the REST API, set the following option to `true`:

.Configuration for anonymous read-only access
[%header,cols="4,4,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_READ_ACCESS_ENABLED`
|`registry.auth.anonymous-read-access.enabled`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===
