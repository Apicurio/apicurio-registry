= {registry} authentication and authorization configuration options

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes the authentication and authorization options for {registry} using {keycloak}. 

You can enable authentication for the {registry} web console and core REST API using {keycloak}. The same {keycloak} realm and users are federated across the {registry} web console and core REST API using Open ID Connect (OIDC) so that you only require one set of credentials.

{registry} provides role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. {registry} also provides content-based authorization at the schema or API level, where only the creator of the registry artifact can update or delete it. {registry} authentication and authorization options are disabled by default. 

.Prerequisites
* {keycloak} is installed and running, and configured with a {keycloak} realm and a user. For more details, see
