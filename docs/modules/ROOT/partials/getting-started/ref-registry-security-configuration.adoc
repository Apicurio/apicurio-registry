= {registry} authentication and authorization configuration options

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes the authentication and authorization options for {registry} using {keycloak}.

You can enable authentication for the {registry} web console and core REST API using {keycloak}. The same {keycloak} realm and users are federated across the {registry} web console and core REST API using Open ID Connect (OIDC) so that you only require one set of credentials.

{registry} supports a number of authorization configurations, including role-based and content-based approaches.
{registry} provides role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles.
{registry} also provides content-based authorization at the schema or API level, where only the creator of the registry artifact can update or delete it. {registry} authentication and authorization options are disabled by default.

.Prerequisites
* {keycloak} is installed and running, and configured with a {keycloak} realm and a user. For more details, see
ifdef::apicurio-registry[]
link:https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started[Getting Started with {keycloak}].

== {registry} authentication using {keycloak}

You can set the following environment variables to configure authentication for the {registry} web console and API using {keycloak}:

.Configuration for {registry} authentication options
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="5,6,2,4",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Description
|Type
|Default
|`AUTH_ENABLED`
|Enables/disables authentication in registry.  When set to `true`, the environment variables that follow are required.
|String
|`false`
|`KEYCLOAK_URL`
|The URL of the {keycloak} authentication server to use. Must end with `/auth`.
|String
|-
|`KEYCLOAK_REALM`
|The {keycloak} realm used for authentication.
|String
|-
|`KEYCLOAK_API_CLIENT_ID`
|The client ID for the {registry} REST API.
|String
|`registry-api`
|`KEYCLOAK_UI_CLIENT_ID`
|The client ID for the {registry} web console.
|String
|`apicurio-registry`
|===

NOTE: By default, {registry} supports authentication using the OpenID Connect protocol.  This means that users (or API clients) must obtain an access token to make authenticated calls to the {registry} REST API.  However, because some tools do not support OpenID Connect, you can also configure {registry} to support HTTP basic authentication by setting the following configuration property to `true`:

.Configuration for {registry} to enable BASIC authentication support
[%header,cols="2,2,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_BASIC_AUTH_ENABLED`
|`registry.auth.basic-auth-client-credentials.enabled`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===


[discrete]
== Role-based authorization in {registry}

Set the following option to `true` to enable role-based authorization in {registry}:

.Configuration for {registry} role-based authorization
[%header,cols="2,2,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_ENABLED`
|`registry.auth.role-based-authorization`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===

You can configure role-based authorization to use roles found in the user's authentication token (for example, granted when authenticating using {keycloak}), or to use role mappings managed internally by {registry}.

[discrete]
=== Using roles from {keycloak}

To enable using roles assigned by {keycloak} set the following environment variables:

.Configuration for {registry} role-based authorization using {keycloak}
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="6,6,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Description
|Type
|Default
|`ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_SOURCE`
| When set to `token`, user roles will be taken from the auth token.
|String
|`token`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_ADMIN`
|The name of the role that indicates a user is an Admin.
|String
|`sr-admin`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_DEVELOPER`
|The name of the role that indicates a user is a Developer.
|String
|`sr-developer`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_READONLY`
|The name of the role that indicates a user has Read Only access.
|String
|`sr-readonly`
|===

When {registry} is configured to use roles from {keycloak}, you must assign {registry} users to at least one
of the following user roles in {keycloak} (note that the role names are configurable via the environment
variables defined in the table above):

.{registry} roles for authentication and authorization
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="2,2,2,2,4",options="header"]
|===
|Role
|Read artifacts
|Write artifacts
|Global rules
|Description
|`sr-admin`
|Yes
|Yes
|Yes
|Full access to all create, read, update, and delete operations.
|`sr-developer`
|Yes
|Yes
|No
|Access to create, read, update, and delete operations, except configuring global rules and import/export. This role can configure artifact rules only.
|`sr-readonly`
|Yes
|No
|No
|Access to read and search operations only. This role cannot configure any rules.
|===

[discrete]
=== Managing roles directly in {registry}

To enable using roles managed internally by {registry}, set the following environment variables:

.Configuration for {registry} role-based authorization using internal role mappings
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="6,6,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Description
|Type
|Default
|`ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_SOURCE`
| When set to `application`, user roles will be managed internally.
|String
|`token`
|===

When using internally managed role mappings, users can be assigned a role using the `/admin/roleMappings`
endpoint in the {registry} REST API.  See the REST API documentation for details on how to use that API.
Users can be granted exactly one role:  `ADMIN`, `DEVELOPER`, or `READ_ONLY`.  Only users with Admin
privileges can grant access to other users.  Because there are no default Admin users in {registry}, it
is usually helpful to configure another way for users to be identified as admins.  This admin-override
configuration can be controlled with the following environment variables:

.Configuration for {registry} admin-override functionality
[.table-expandable,width="100%",cols="6,6,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Description
|Type
|Default
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_ENABLED`
| Enables the admin-override feature.
|String
|`false`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_FROM`
|Where to look for admin-override information.  Only `token` is currently supported.
|String
|`token`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_TYPE`
|The type of information used to determine if a user is an admin.  Values depend on the value of the FROM variable, for example, `role` or `claim` when FROM is `token`.
|String
|`role`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_ROLE`
|The name of the role that indicates a user is an Admin.
|String
|`sr-admin`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CLAIM`
|The name of a JWT token claim to use for determining admin-override.
|String
|`org-admin`
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CLAIM-VALUE`
|The value that the JWT token claim indicated by the CLAIM variable must be for the user to be granted admin-override.
|String
|`true`
|===

For example, you can use the admin-override feature to assign the `sr-admin` role to a single user
in {keycloak}, which grants that user the admin role.  That user can then use the `/admin/roleMappings`
REST API (or associated UI) to grant roles to additional users (including additional admins).

[discrete]
== {registry} artifact owner-only authorization option

Set the following option to `true` to enable owner-only authorization for updates to schema and API artifacts in {registry}:

.Configuration for owner-only authorization
[%header,cols="2,2,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`OWNER_ONLY_AUTHZ_ENABLED`
|`registry.auth.owner-only-authorization`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===

Enabling owner-only authorization results in a configuration where users with write access can only modify
content that they themselves created.  So users will not be able to update or delete artifacts created by
other users.

[discrete]
== Additional {registry} authorization options

In addition to the two main types of authorization (role-based and owner-based authorization), {registry}
supports the following authorization related features.

[discrete]
=== Anonymous read-only access

To enable anonymous users (REST API calls with no authentication credentials provided) to be allowed to make
read-only calls to the REST API, the following option must be set to `true`:

.Configuration for anonymous read-only access
[%header,cols="2,2,1,1"]
|===
|Environment variable
|Java system property
|Type
|Default value
|`REGISTRY_AUTH_ANONYMOUS-READ-ACCESS_ENABLED`
|`registry.auth.anonymous-read-access.enabled`
|Boolean
|`false`
|===
