= {registry} overview

{registry} is a datastore for sharing standard event schemas and API designs across API and event-driven architectures. You can use {registry} to decouple the structure of your data from your client applications, and to share and manage your data types and API descriptions at runtime using a REST interface.

For example, client applications can dynamically push or pull the latest schema updates to or from the registry at runtime without needing to redeploy. Developer teams can query the registry for existing schemas required for services already deployed in production, and can register new schemas required for new services in development.  

You can enable client applications to use schemas and API designs stored in {registry} by specifying the registry URL in your client code. For example, the registry can store schemas used to serialize and deserialize messages, which can then be referenced from your client applications to ensure that the messages that they send and receive are compatible with those schemas.

Using {registry} to decouple your data structure from your applications reduces costs by decreasing overall message size, and also creates efficiencies by increasing consistent reuse of schemas and API designs across your organization. {registry} also provides a graphical user interface to make it easy for developers and administrators to manage registry content.

{registry} is based on the Apicurio Registry open source community project. For details, see https://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-registry.

== {registry} features
{registry} provides the following main features:

* Support for multiple payload formats for standard event schemas and API specifications 

ifdef::rh-service-registry[]
* Pluggable storage options including Red Hat AMQ Streams, Data Grid, or Java Persistence API 
endif::[]
ifdef::apicurio-registry[]
* Pluggable storage options including Apache Kafka, Infinispan, or Java Persistence API 
endif::[]

* Registry content management by user interface, REST API command, Maven plug-in, or Java client

* Rules for content validation and version compatibility to govern how registry content evolves over time

* Full Apache Kafka schema registry support, including integration with Kafka Connect for external systems 

* Client serializers/deserializers (SerDes) to validate Kafka and other message types at runtime

* Cloud-native Quarkus Java runtime for low memory footprint and fast deployment times

* Compatibility with existing Confluent schema registry client applications

* Operator-based installation of {registry} on OpenShift

= {registry} artifacts

The items stored in {registry}, such as event schemas and API specifications, are known as registry _artifacts_. The following shows an example of an Apache Avro schema artifact in JSON format for a simple share price application:

[source,json]
----
{
   "type": "record",
   "name": "price",
   "namespace": "com.example",
   "fields": [
       {
           "name": "symbol",
           "type": "string"
       },
       {
           "name": "price",
           "type": "string"
       }
   ]
}
----

When a schema or API contract is added as an artifact in the registry, client applications can then use that schema or API contract to validate that client messages conform to the correct data structure at runtime. 

{registry} supports a wide range of message payload formats for standard event schemas and API specifications. For example, supported formats include Apache Avro, Google protocol buffers, GraphQL, AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, and others. For more details, see xref:registry-artifact-types[].

[id="registry-rest-api"]
= Registry REST API
Using the Registry REST API, client applications can manage the artifacts in {registry}. This API provides create, read, update, and delete operations for:

Artifacts::
Manage the schema and API design artifacts stored in the registry. Also includes browse or search for artifacts, and manage the lifecycle state of an artifact: enabled, disabled, or deprecated. 
Artifact versions::
Manage the versions that are created when artifact content is updated. Also includes browse or search for versions, and manage the lifecycle state of a version: enabled, disabled, or deprecated.
Artifact metadata::
Manage details such as when the artifact was created, last updated, and so on.
Global rules::
Configure rules to govern the content evolution of all artifacts to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to the registry. Global rules are applied only if an artifact does not have its own specific artifact rules configured. 
Artifact rules::
Configure rules to govern the content evolution of a specific artifact to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to the registry. Artifact rules override any global rules configured. 

For detailed information, see the link:files/registry-rest-api.htm[Apicurio Registry REST API documentation].

.Compatibility with other schema registries
The {registry} REST API is compatible with the Confluent schema registry REST API. This means that applications using Confluent client libraries can use {registry} instead as a drop-in replacement.

= Storage options
{registry} supports the following underlying storage implementations for artifacts: 

ifdef::apicurio-registry[]

* In-memory 
* Java Persistence API 
* Apache Kafka 
* Apache Kafka Streams
* Infinispan

NOTE: The in-memory storage option is suitable for a development environment only. All data is lost when restarting this storage implementation. All other storage options are suitable for development and production environments.

For more details, see https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry. 

endif::[]

ifdef::rh-service-registry[]

* Red Hat AMQ Streams 1.4 (General Availability)
* Red Hat Data Grid 8.0 (Technical Preview only)
* Java Persistence API - PostgreSQL 12 database (Technical Preview only)

endif::[]

For details on how to install into your preferred storage option, see xref:installing-the-registry[].

//The {registry} Operator enables you to install and configure {registry} with your selected storage implementation on OpenShift.

[id="client-serde"]
= Client serializers/deserializers 
Event-based producer applications can use serializers to encode messages that conform to a specific event schema. Consumer applications can then use deserializers to validate that messages have been serialized using the correct schema, based on a specific schema ID. 

.{registry} client serializer/deserializer architecture
image::../images/getting-started/registry-serdes-architecture.png[Registry SerDes architecture]

{registry} provides client serializers/deserializers to validate the following message types at runtime:

* Apache Avro
* Google protocol buffers
* JSON Schema

The {registry} Maven repository and source code distributions include the serializer/deserializer implementations for these message types, which client developers can use to integrate with the registry. These implementations include custom `io.apicurio.registry.utils.serde` Java classes for each supported message type, which client applications can use to pull schemas from the registry at runtime for validation.

[id="registry-demo"]
= Registry demonstration examples
{registry} provides an open source demonstration example of Apache Avro serialization/deserialization with storage in Apache Kafka Streams. This example shows how the serializer/deserializer obtains the Avro schema from the registry at runtime and uses it to serialize and deserialize Kafka messages. For more details, see link:https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry-demo[].

This demonstration also provides simple examples of both Avro and JSON Schema serialization/deserialization with storage in Apache Kafka:
