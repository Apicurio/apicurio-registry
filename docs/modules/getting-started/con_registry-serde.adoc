= Client serializers/deserializers 
Event-based producer applications can use serializers to encode messages that conform to a specific event schema. Consumer applications can then use deserializers to validate that messages have been serialized using the correct schema, based on a specific schema ID. 

.{registry} client serializer/deserializer architecture
image::images/getting-started/registry-serdes-architecture.png[Registry Serdes architecture]

{registry} provides client serializers/deserializers (Serdes) to validate the following message types at runtime:

* Apache Avro
* Google protocol buffers
* JSON Schema

The {registry} Maven repository and source code distributions include the serializer/deserializer implementations for these message types, which client developers can use to integrate with the registry. These implementations include custom `io.apicurio.registry.utils.serde` Java classes for each supported message type, which client applications can use to pull schemas from the registry at runtime for validation.
