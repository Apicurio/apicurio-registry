You can install the {registry} Operator on your OpenShift cluster from the OperatorHub. The OperatorHub is available from the OpenShift Container Platform web console and provides an interface for cluster administrators to discover and install Operators. For more details on the OperatorHub, see the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/operators/olm-understanding-operatorhub.html[OpenShift documentation].

.Prerequisites

* You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift cluster
* You must have set up your registry storage. For more details, see
