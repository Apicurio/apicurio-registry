= Setting up {kafka-streams} storage on OpenShift 

This topic explains how to install and configure Kafka Streams-based storage for {registry} on OpenShift using {kafka-streams}. This storage option is suitable for production environments. 

You can install {registry} in an existing Kafka cluster or create a new Kafka cluster, depending on your environment.

.Prerequisites
* You must have an OpenShift cluster with cluster administrator access.
* You must have installed {kafka-streams}. For more details, see the instructions in xref:installing-kafka-streams-operatorhub[]

.Procedure


. If you do not already have a Kafka cluster configured, create a new Kafka cluster with {kafka-streams}. For example, in the OpenShift OperatorHub:
+
ifdef::apicurio-registry[]
.. Click *Installed Operators* > *{kafka-streams}*.
endif::[]
ifdef::rh-service-registry[]
.. Click *Installed Operators* > *Red Hat Integration - {kafka-streams}*.
endif::[]
.. Under *Provided APIs* > *Kafka*, click *Create Instance* to create a new Kafka cluster.
.. Edit the definition as appropriate and click *Create*. 
+
The default example creates a cluster with 3 Zookeeper nodes and 3 Kafka nodes using _ephemeral_ storage, which means that all data is lost when the Pods are no longer running on OpenShift. 

. Create a topic to store the to store the {registry} artifacts:
+
.. Under *Provided APIs* > *Kafka Topic*, click *Create topic* 
.. Edit the topic `name` from `my-topic` to the required `storage-topic`.

. Create a topic to store the to store the {registry} global IDs:
.. Under *Provided APIs* > *Kafka Topic*, click *Create topic*.
.. Edit the topic `name` from `my-topic` to the required `global-id-topic`.
