= {operator} quickstart

You can quickly install the {operator} on the command line by using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

The quickstart example deploys your {registry} instance with 
in-memory storage:

* xref:registry-operator-quickstart[]
* xref:registry-quickstart[]

NOTE: The recommended installation option for production environments is the OpenShift OperatorHub. The recommended storage option is an SQL database for performance, stability, and data management.
