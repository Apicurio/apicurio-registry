= Installing {operator} using Operator Lifecycle Manager

The recommended way to install {operator} is to use the link:{LinkOLMDocs}[{NameOLMDocs}] (OLM), which can automatically manage the Operator deployment and upgrades.

{operator} is released to the link:{LinkOperatorHub}[{NameOperatorHub}], so if your cluster has the OLM and OperatorHub installed, the cluster administrator can use the OpenShift web console to deploy the {operator}:

.Prerequisites
* You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift cluster.

.Procedure
. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges.

. Create a new OpenShift project:

.. In the left navigation menu, click *Home* > *Project* > *Create Project*.
.. Enter a project name, for example, `my-project`, and click *Create*.

. In the left navigation menu, click *Operators* > *OperatorHub*.

ifdef::apicurio-registry[]
. In the *Filter by keyword* text box, enter `registry` to find the *{operator}*.
endif::[]
ifdef::service-registry[]
. In the *Filter by keyword* text box, enter `registry` to find the *Red Hat Integration - {operator}*.
endif::[]
. Read the information about the Operator, and click *Install*.
This displays the *Create Operator Subscription* page.

. Select your subscription settings, for example:
** *Installation Mode* > *A specific namespace on the cluster* > *my-project*
ifdef::service-registry[]
* *Update Channel*: Select one of the following:
*** *2.0.x*: Includes patch updates only, such as 2.0.1 and 2.0.2. For example, an installation on 2.0.x automatically ignores 2.1.x.
*** *2.x*: Includes all minor and patch updates, such as 2.1.0 and 2.0.1. For example, an installation on 2.0.x automatically upgrades to 2.1.x. 
endif::[]
ifdef::apicurio-registry[]
** *Update Channel* > *2.x*
endif::[]
ifdef::service-registry[]
** *Approval Strategy* > *Manual*
endif::[]
ifdef::apicurio-registry[]
** *Approval Strategy* > *Automatic*
endif::[]

. Click *Subscribe*.
This displays the *Operators* > *Installed Operators* page.

. Wait a few moments until the *Status* for the {operator} displays *Succeeded* and the subscription is *Up to Date*.
